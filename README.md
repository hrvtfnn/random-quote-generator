Fun hobby project to practice HTML, CSS, JS ðŸ¥° <br/>

# What I learned ðŸª„

I learned a lot about JavaScript while working on my first project with it, and it was worth the time. <br>
It was challenging to figure out what to do with the 'Read More on Wikipedia' button. I read many articles and watched around 10 videos on YouTube to figure out how to link the random author's name to the URL, but I'm proud of myself for persevering and not giving up. <br> 
For the color picker, I used [Kevin Powell's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyuao3G-2qg&ab_channel=KevinPowell) to help, but I didn't follow it exactly. I watched it several times and used it as a reference to make sure I was on the right track. <br>
Although I have only solved one of the many mysteries of JavaScript, it feels like a significant accomplishment. ðŸŽ‰
