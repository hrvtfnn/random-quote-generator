# What I learned ðŸª„

I learned a lot about JavaScript while working on my first project with it, and it was worth the time. <br>
It was challenging to figure out what to do with the 'Read More on Wikipedia' button. I read many articles and watched around 10 videos on YouTube to figure out how to link the random author's name to the URL, but I'm proud of myself for persevering and not giving up. <br> 
Although I have only solved one of the many mysteries of JavaScript, it feels like a significant accomplishment. ðŸŽ‰

# To Do List for the future

- [x] Update CSS to look prettier
- [x] Update to be responsive
- [x] Make the copy button work
- [x] Add Facebook button
- [x] Figure out how to make the "Read more" button connect to Wikipedia
